A very British education,
classes taught in English </h3>

We believe that child centred, exploratory learning, will teach your child how to think, question and explore new ideas. All learning at King’s College is based upon these core skills; not simply a list of memorised facts, but real knowledge and understanding. We cannot promise you that your child will go to one of the world’s top universities, no one can. We can, however, give your son or daughter the best possible chance to reach their full potential, as a thinking, conscientious young person.
We can say with confidence that we treat every child as an individual and that we will do everything we can to give them the best start in their life.
